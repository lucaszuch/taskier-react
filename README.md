# Taskier (React App)
`Work it, make it, do it
Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger`

## Features:
Quoting Kanye West in this great project (cannot say the same about the joke), Taskier got a brother built in React. The drill is still the same, you create a task, complete it, delete it, or leave there sitting while you play some Xbox. There's improment in the visual (let's be fair, the violet was daunting!), also now it is mobile friendly.

## Requisites:
- Nodejs.

## Technologies/Frameworks:
- React;
- HTML;
- CSS;
- JS;
- Bootstrap;
- Font Awesome.

## How to set up:
That's a react app, hit `npm start` and let it flow!!! Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Extra notes:
I've found a available API key, as it is still online and widely available, I haven't hidden the information.
